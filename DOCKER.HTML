                Docker provides the OS level Virtulization without needing to install any OS in the system or using VMWare.
                It reduce the hectic part of installing new OS for every time it need in new project. plus it reduce the installation time.
                In traditional way it take 30-60 min to install, but in docker it is not more than few seconds.
